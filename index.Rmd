* Suggested Venue: Hotel Barcelona Princess 

To do this activity the first option would be to use the Hotel Princess meeting rooms:

<img src = "princess1.png" width="800"> 

All the orange area is more than 400sqm that will be used for the activity. These meeting rooms are separated by panels so, for this activity they will be open making one space. Some of them have big windows so, as they will be open all the area will have natural lighting.

We will split guests in teams of 30 pax - each group will have 1 assistants/guides who will help them during the activity. 
When they will have their bags full, they will have to return to the starting spot (Coll d‚ÄôEstenalles) where they will find some people of our staff and trucks to collect the bags.

### **Animal Shelters Help** 

The idea is to split guests in 6 groups of 50 pax - each group will go to a different animal shelter. 
All the animal shelters that we propose are located from 20 to 45 minutes from the hotel Princess in Barcelona.

<img src = "prote2.png" width="800"> 

The activity will be adapted to each shelter needs, we will  organize different activities at each shelter so guests will do them in turns.

  *Painting - we will buy paint cans, rollers and brushes and a group of 10/15 guests will be painting some of the facilities.

  *Cleaning - we will buy and donate brooms, dustpans, bleach and buckets and a group of 10/15 guests will be cleaning the facilities

  *Dog/cats cleaning and brushing - we will buy and donate brushes, scissors, gauzes, etc and a group of 10/15 pax will be helping the animals to be clean

  *Setting the animals‚Äô places - we will buy and donate blankets and beds for the animals and one group of 10/15 will take care of this.

Depending on the shelter needs we will donate other materials as feed, sand for cats, office materials, etc.
